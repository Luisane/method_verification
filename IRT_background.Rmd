# Background

The GSP Neonatal IRT assay is a solid phase, two-site
fluoroimmunometric assay based on the direct sandwich technique in
which two monoclonal antibodies are directed against two separate
antigenic determinants on the IRT molecule.  Patient specimens,
Calibrators and Controls are reacted simultaneously with immobilized
monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific antigenic site on
the IRT molecule and europium-labeled monoclonal antibodies (directed
against a different antigenic site) in the assay buffer.  The assay
buffer elutes the IRT from each sample. Only one incubation is
required for the assay. 

DELFIA Inducer then dissociates europium ions from the labeled
antibody into solution, where they form highly fluorescent chelates
with components of the Inducer Solution.  The fluorescence in each
well is then measured.  The fluorescence of each sample is
proportional to the concentration of IRT in the sample.
