# Background

The GSP neonatal-OH-progesterone (17-OHP) assay is a solid phase,
time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay based on the competitive reaction
between europium-labeled 17-OHP and sample 17 OHP for a limited amount
of binding sites on 17-OHP specific polyclonal antibodies. Danazol
facilitates the release of 17-OHP from the binding proteins. A second
antibody, directed against rabbit IgG, is coated to the solid phase,
giving convenient separation of the antibody-bound and free antigen.

DELFIA inducer dissociates europium ions from the labeled antigen into
solution where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components
of DELFIA Inducer. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The
fluorescence of each sample is inversely proportional to the
concentration of 17-OHP in the sample.
